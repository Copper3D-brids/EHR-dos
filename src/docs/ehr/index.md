# DigitalTWIN on FHIR

DigitalTwin on FHIR: Enhancing Healthcare Research

Aim:
The goal of DigitalTwin on FHIR is to leverage SPARC and Hospital EHR data to create a virtual patient model for research purposes. This approach aims to enhance the interoperability and accessibility of healthcare data, making it more compliant with Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standards.

Methods:
To achieve this, we will collect and store various types of data, including Measurements, Models, Workflows, and Tools, in the FHIR format. This structured approach ensures that the data is easily shareable and usable across different healthcare systems and research platforms.
